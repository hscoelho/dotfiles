;;; WINDOW
;; This section configures window management in Emacs, enhancing the way buffers
;; are displayed for a more efficient workflow. The `window' use-package helps
;; streamline how various buffers are shown, especially those related to help,
;; diagnostics, and completion.
;;
;; Note: I have left some commented-out code below that may facilitate your
;; Emacs journey later on. These configurations can be useful for displaying
;; other types of buffers in side windows, allowing for a more organized workspace.
